ðŸ‘‹ Heya to everyone who stumbled onto my profile.

My name's Niklas, you can just call me Nik or EnK_ though, doesn't really matter.

I am a single developer who develops stuff in .NET and C# for most of the time, but also occasionally fiddles around with other langs.

----
## A short list of things I do:
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: [Ocarina of Time Item Tracker](https://github.com/EnKdev/EnKdevs-Item-Trackers)

----
## Finished projects:
- [SessionPass](https://github.com/EnKdev/SessionPass) - A collection of pseudo-authentication libraries written in C# to authenticate sessions for applications
- [TourLogger](https://github.com/EnKdev/TourLogger) - A pretty much extensive companion tool for players of ETS2/ATS to log their tours along with relevant data (Distance driven, Fuel that has been used, freight, etc) into one central database!

----
## Want to support me by leaving a small tip so I can get myself the caffeine-kick that a dev like me needs daily?

- ðŸ’¬ [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/enkdev) - My Ko-Fi Page! (Entirely optional though, you're not obliged to tip or to do anything <3)
