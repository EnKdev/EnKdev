### Software from Germany, made in Germany... by just one dude.
ðŸ‘‹ Heya to everyone who stumbled onto my profile.

My name's Niklas, you can just call me Nik or EnK_ though, doesn't really matter.

I am a single developer who develops stuff in .NET and C# for most of the time, but also occasionally fiddles around with other langs.

----
## A short list of things I do:
- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: [TourLogger](https://github.com/enkdev/tourlogger) | [HAL-Map](https://github.com/enkdev/hal-map) | [TourLogger-Backend](https://github.com/enkdev/TourLogger-Backend)
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: C++

----
## Finished projects:
- [SessionPass](https://github.com/EnKdev/SessionPass) - A collection of pseudo-authentication libraries written in C# to authenticate sessions for applications

----
## Got questions? Here's how to reach me:

- ðŸ“« Discord - EnK_#1337 (Friend Requests are limited to Friends of Friends or Server Members though!)

----
## Want to support me by leaving a small tip so I can get myself the caffeine-kick that a dev like me needs daily?

- ðŸ’¬ [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/enkdev) - My Ko-Fi Page! (Entirely optional though, you're not obliged to tip or to do anything <3)

## âš¡ Fun fact: Colibris fly backwards.
